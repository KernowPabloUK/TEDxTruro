                        Overcoming and facing significant personal challenges, including a panic attack disorder
                        that left

                    <p>Kate, a proud Cornish woman, has transformed her life through resilience and creativity.
                        After
                        surviving a life-threatening brain haemorrhage at 35, her outlook on life changed
                        drastically and
                        made her realise that tomorrow is never promised. This experience sparked a renewed
                        focus on
                        creativity and the desire to turn personal challenges into meaningful opportunities.
                        Inspired by the
                        values of her Granny Florence, who taught her that “there's no such word as can't,” Kate
                        founded
                        Flotsam Flo—a business dedicated to repurposing difficult to recycle materials, such as
                        wetsuits,
                        life jackets and more.
                        Through Flotsam Flo, Kate works with local charities, including a Hospice that cared for
                        a close
                        friend before her passing. A former secondary school teacher, Kate also leads workshops
                        that raise
                        awareness about waste and show others how they can creatively repurpose materials,
                        spreading the
                        message that there's other ways to approach waste. Through her journey, Kate
                        demonstrates how
                        overcoming personal adversity can lead to creative solutions and impactful contributions
